# React Weather Api

## Project Description
a React app that displays the weather in a city of the userâ€™s choice. The user  able to enter or select the name of the city that they
would like to see the weather for. For this App I used the OpenWeatherMap API: https://openweathermap.org/current to retrieve weather
